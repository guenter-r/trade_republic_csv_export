# TradeRepublic CSV Export ( 1.1.0 )
Scroll through your transactions in your Trade Republic account to see how you earned and spent your money. Unfortunately, Trade Republic provides no way to export your transactions, making it hard to keep track of your finances outside of the web page. This extension is a quick solution to the problem.

Follow these steps to make the export work for you:

➡️ Install
➡️ Go to your "transactions" page (https://app.traderepublic.com/profile/transactions)
➡️ Click on the extension icon
➡️ Download starts automatically

💭 Keep in mind, only the loaded (visible) transactions will be exported

This extension simply exports all transactions in a csv file. No more magic, no more struggles.
